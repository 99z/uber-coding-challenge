Coding challenge or existing code?
==================================

Welcome! Below is a description of a project that will give us some insight
into your current level of experience.

The coding challenge is optional ([guidelines
below](#coding_challenge_guidelines)) if you already have some code that you're
proud of and can share with us.

Existing code
-------------

If you have existing code, please follow the following guidelines:

* Include a link to the hosted repository (e.g. Github, Bitbucket...). We cannot
  review archives or single files.
* The repo should include a README that follows the [principles described
  below](#readme) In particular, please make sure to include high-level
  explanation about what the code is doing.
* Ideally, the code you're providing:
  * Has been written by you alone. If not, please tell us which part you wrote
    and are most proud of in the README.
  * Is using web technologies.
  * Is deployed and hosted somewhere.

Readme
------

Regardless of whether it's your own code or a coding challenge, write your
README as if it was for a production service, and include the following items:

* Description of the problem and solution.
* Whether the solution focuses on back-end, front-end or if it's full stack.
* Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural.
* Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do
  differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.
* Link to other code you're particularly proud of.
* Link to your resume or public profile.
* Link to to the hosted application where applicable.

How we review
-------------

Your application will be reviewed by at least three of our engineers. The
aspects of your code we will judge include:

* Functionality: Does the application do what was asked? If there is anything
  missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
* Code quality: Is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?
  Are there any code smells or other red flags?
* Testing: How thorough are the automated tests? Will they be difficult to
  change if the requirements of the application were to change?
* UX: Is the web interface understandable and pleasing to use?
* Technical choices: Do choices of libraries, databases, etc. seem appropriate
  for the chosen application?

Coding Challenge Guidelines
===========================

This is a simple project, but organize, design, test, document and deploy your
code as if it were going into production. Please then send us a link to the
hosted repository (e.g. Github, Bitbucket...).

Functional spec
---------------

Prototype **one** of the following projects:

1. Departure Times
2. SF Movies
3. Email Service
4. Food Trucks

The UX/UI is totally up to you. If you like, get creative and add additional
features a user might find useful!

### Departure Times

Create a service that gives real-time departure time for public transportation
(use freely available public API). The app should geolocalize the user.

Here are some examples of freely available data:

* [511](http://511.org/developer-resources_transit-api.asp) (San Francisco)
* [Nextbus](http://www.nextbus.com/xmlFeedDocs/NextBusXMLFeed.pdf) (San
  Francisco)

### SF Movies

Create a service that shows on a map where movies have been filmed in San
Francisco. The user should be able to filter the view using autocompletion
search.

The data is available on [DataSF](http://www.datasf.org/): [Film
Locations](https://data.sfgov.org/Arts-Culture-and-Recreation-/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am).

### Email Service

Create a service that accepts the necessary information and sends emails. It
should provide an abstraction between two different email service providers.
If one of the services goes down, your service can quickly failover to
a different provider without affecting your customers.

Example Email Providers:

* [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/user/signup) - [Simple Send Documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/mail.html)
* [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com) - [Simple Send Documentation](http://documentation.mailgun.com/quickstart.html#sending-messages)
* [Mandrill](https://mandrillapp.com) - [Simple Send Documentation](https://mandrillapp.com/api/docs/messages.JSON.html#method-send)

All three services are free to try and are pretty painless to sign up for, so
please register your own test accounts on each.

### Food Trucks

Create a service that tells the user what types of food trucks might be found
near a specific location on a map.

The data is available on [DataSF](http://www.datasf.org/): [Food
Trucks](https://data.sfgov.org/Permitting/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat)

Technical spec
--------------

The architecture will be split between a back-end and a web front-end, for
instance providing a JSON in/out RESTful API. Feel free to use any other
technologies provided that the general client/service architecture is
respected.

Choose **one** of the following technical tracks that best suits your skillset:

1. **Full-stack**: include both front-end and back-end.
2. **Back-end track**: include a minimal front-end (e.g. a static view or API
   docs). Write, document and test your API as if it will be used by other
   services.
3. **Front-end track**: include a minimal back-end, or use the data service
   directly. Focus on making the interface as polished as possible.

### Back-end

We believe there is no one-size-fits-all technology. Good engineering is about
using the right tool for the right job, and constantly learning about them.
Therefore, feel free to mention in your `README` how much experience you have
with the technical stack you choose, we will take note of that when reviewing
your challenge.

Here are some technologies we are more familiar with:

* **Python** (most of our back-end uses this language)
* JavaScript
* Ruby
* PHP
* Go
* C++
* Haskell
* Java

You are also free to use any web framework. If you choose to use a framework
that results in boilerplate code in the repository, please detail in your
README which code was written by you (as opposed to generated code).

### Front-end

The front-end should ideally be a single page app with a single `index.html`
linking to external JS/CSS/etc. You may take this opportunity to demonstrate
your CSS3 or HTML5 knowledge.

We recommend using [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) for
front-end MVC, and recommend against using heavier front-end frameworks (like
Angular, for example). That way we can get better insight into your thought
process and your understanding of the framework itself.

Host it!
--------

When youâ€™re done, host it somewhere (e.g. on Amazon EC2, Heroku, Google
AppEngine, etc.).
